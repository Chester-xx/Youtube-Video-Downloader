# To Do List
- Need to implement a download and output tracker for both ytdlp and ffmpeg
    1. Standard Download
    2. Create event updaters for both
    3. Must not freeze the processes of the main program while the command lines run

**NOW**
- Improve download quality options
- Expand video information panel (desc, duration, upload date)
- Download history section (+redownload option?, clear history, pin favs?)
- add option so save file as a specific name (in preview add final file name.ext)
- Program information and about section
- user menu panel
- animate downloads?
- Language options?
